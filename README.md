## The Story

I had to install an [IP camera](http://www.foscam.com/) some weeks ago and among available features, it can perform movement detection : when a movement is detected, some photo (snapshot) and a video are created and saved to an FTP folder. Cool ! I though I could configure this feature and that's what I did. Everything worked fine but I had no way to take a look to the images/video that were taken on movement detection. I also wanted to be notified on movement detection and ... what about maintenance ? Were these images and video supposed to remain forever in the upload folder ?

Well, there was several problem to solve and services to implement: this project has been created to solve these problem and provide missing features.
